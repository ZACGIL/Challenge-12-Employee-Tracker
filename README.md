# Employee Tracker
Hi!

My name is Zac Gilfoyle.

## Description
This repository contains Javascript and SQL used to create an employee tracker.

This is a culmination of the skills developed whilst learning SQL.

It utilizes Node.js and various other packages to create a command-line-interface for generating a employee tracker.

Below is a link to a walk-through of the employee tracker.
